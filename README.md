# django-interstitial

### Just a simple django app for interstitials.

An arts and culture magazine likes to feature interstitial advertisements every once in a while directing users to links on and off the site.  This simply allows site editors to configure the interstitials.  It contains very basic jquery and css.  Still seems to look good :)

### Requirements

- django >= 1.5
- jquery

### Settings

- INTERSTITIAL_ON (default True)
- INTERSTITIAL_CACHE (default False)
- INTERSTITIAL_FORCE (default False)
